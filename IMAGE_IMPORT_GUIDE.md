# Image Import Guide - Avoiding 413 (Content Too Large) Error

## Problem Solved âœ…

The 413 error was caused by trying to upload 86.54MB of image files at once. We've optimized the images to reduce the total size to just 1.26MB (98.5% reduction).

## How to Import Products Now

### Option 1: Use Optimized Images (Recommended)

1. **Use the optimized images** located in `public/products/optimized/`
   - These are the same images but much smaller (98.5% smaller)
   - Total size: 1.26MB instead of 86.54MB

2. **Import Process:**
   - Go to Admin â†’ Products â†’ Import
   - Upload your `GemInventory.csv` file
   - Upload the optimized images from `public/products/optimized/`
   - Click "Preview Import" then "Import Products"

### Option 2: Import CSV First, Then Add Images

1. **Import CSV data only:**
   - Upload just the `GemInventory.csv` file
   - The system will automatically detect the large file size and import CSV only
   - Products will be created without images

2. **Add images later:**
   - Use the optimized images from `public/products/optimized/`
   - Upload them individually or in small batches

## Image Optimization Details

- **Original size:** 86.54MB
- **Optimized size:** 1.26MB
- **Savings:** 98.5%
- **Quality:** Still high quality (800x800px, 80% JPEG quality)
- **Format:** Converted to JPEG for better compression

## Technical Changes Made

1. **Fixed API endpoint** to properly handle FormData
2. **Added authentication** to the import endpoint
3. **Created image optimization script** (`scripts/optimize-images.js`)
4. **Updated frontend** to handle large file uploads gracefully
5. **Added middleware** for better file upload handling

## Files Modified

- `app/api/admin/import/products/route.ts` - Fixed FormData handling
- `app/admin/products/import/page.tsx` - Added size checking and CSV-only import
- `next.config.js` - Added experimental features
- `middleware.ts` - Added file upload handling
- `scripts/optimize-images.js` - Image optimization script

## Next Steps

1. Try importing with the optimized images first
2. If you still get errors, use the CSV-only import option
3. The system will now handle large uploads much better

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check file sizes** - Make sure you're using the optimized images
2. **Try CSV-only import** - Import data first, then add images separately
3. **Check browser console** - Look for any error messages
4. **Restart the development server** - Sometimes needed after config changes

The 413 error should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
