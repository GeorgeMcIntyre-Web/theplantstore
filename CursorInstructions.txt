we need to get this to work do whatever it takes please
please can you proceed and follow best practices in all cases
please do all these items.


we need to get this branch working so please think about this but carry on.
do not ask until really required
you got stuck


we need to do a commit 
continue
you got stuck

we now need to look at all branches with coded features that are at a good level
the idea to do also clean the branch structure to follow best practices.
please take a look at the whole repo and give me a break down of what we need to do to get 
this Structureed as per best practices

see below
feature/in-app-notifications
feature/contact-form-backend
feature/paystack-integration
refactor/ui-improvements
feature/dynamic-plant-data
feature/in-app-notifications
feature/contact-form-backend
feature/paystack-integration

I think there should be a main branch and then a deloper branch with the feature coming off that
At the moment the main branch is setup in digital ocean that if it is push to then DO tries to 
deploy this app.
We also need to look at best practices for DO when developing my app in cursor ide pro. I also have the db in DO.
