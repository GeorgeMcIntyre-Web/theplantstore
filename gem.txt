Project Overview: The House Plant Store
This document provides a complete summary of the work completed on the admin dashboard, a list of resolved issues, and a prioritized action plan for the remaining features.

Part 1: What Has Been Accomplished
We have successfully built and deployed a robust, multi-faceted admin dashboard. The core infrastructure is complete, and several key features are fully functional.

1. Complete Admin Dashboard UI & Routing:

All primary admin sections now have dedicated pages:

/admin/products

/admin/orders

/admin/customers

/admin/users

The folder structure has been corrected to follow Next.js App Router conventions, resolving all previous routing and build errors.

2. Full Product Management (CRUD):

Create & Read: Admins can view a list of all products and can create new products using a detailed form.

Update: The "Edit" functionality is in place, allowing all product details, including price and stock (inventory), to be updated.

API: A complete set of API endpoints (/api/admin/products) now supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.

3. Role-Based Access Control:

The admin dashboard is now fully aware of user roles (SUPER_ADMIN, PLANT_MANAGER).

It dynamically displays management cards based on the logged-in user's permissions.

A user-friendly message is shown if a user has insufficient permissions to view any content.

4. Resolved Critical Build & Deployment Issues:

Module Not Found Errors: Corrected all incorrect import paths (@/lib/db, @/lib/auth).

Database Connection at Build Time: Resolved the DATABASE_URL not found error by implementing dynamic rendering (export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic') on all admin pages that fetch data. This was a crucial step for successful deployment.

TypeScript Type Errors: Fixed all type-safety issues, including:

Handling null values from the database in the ProductForm.

Using the correct OrderStatus enum (DELIVERED) in database queries.

Part 2: What Still Needs to Be Done (Action Plan)
The application is now stable and largely functional. Here are the final features to implement to complete the project.

1. Implement "Delete Product" Functionality (High Priority):

Task: Add a "Delete" button next to the "Edit" button on the product list page (/admin/products).

Implementation:

When the "Delete" button is clicked, it should trigger a confirmation modal (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this product? This action cannot be undone.").

Upon confirmation, it should call the existing DELETE method on the /api/admin/products/[id] endpoint.

After successful deletion, the product list should refresh automatically.

2. Build the "Order Details" Page:

Task: Create the page at /admin/orders/[id]. The main orders list already links here, but it currently results in a 404 error.

Implementation:

This page should fetch and display all information for a single order, including the customer's details, shipping address, and a list of all products in the order.

3. Add "Update Order Status" Functionality:

Task: On the new "Order Details" page, allow an admin to change the order's status.

Implementation:

Add a dropdown menu with all possible OrderStatus values (PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, etc.).

Include a text input to add or update a tracking number.

Create a "Save" button that calls the existing PUT method on the /api/admin/orders/[id] endpoint to update the order.

4. Finalize User Management:

Task: Allow a SUPER_ADMIN to edit user roles.

Implementation:

On the /admin/users page, add an "Edit" button for each user.

This could lead to a simple form where the user's role can be changed via a dropdown.

This will require a new API endpoint (PUT /api/admin/users/[id]) to handle the update.
